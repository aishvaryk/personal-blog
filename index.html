							<p>These days, the Nvidia vs AMD battle is in an awkward (or exciting, depending on your perspective) position. Almost a year after the release of its Turing architecture with the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 2080, RTX 2070 and RTX 2060, which is leading the pack in sales, Nvidia has recently rolled out its Super RTX cards, the RTX 2080 Super, RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2060 Super, all of which boast clock and memory speed boosts.

								<h3>Nvidia vs AMD: The History</h3>
								<p>US tech firm Nvidia has been around since 1993, founded with the intention of capitalising on the imminent explosion in computer graphics technology – it was the year the likes of Doom and Myst came out, setting new standards in the visuals that computers could produce, and Nvidia wanted to tap into that. Since then, the company has become known for its GeForce line of graphics cards (for desktops) and integrated graphics (more compact solutions, often for laptops). Its biggest rival in these areas is AMD, but Nvidia has also expanded its operations into other areas of tech – which we'll get into later on.
									Founded way back in 1969, AMD is actually focused on CPUs or Central Processing Units first and foremost, and in that regard its biggest competitor is Intel. However, since the 2006 acquisition of graphics card company ATI, the US company has also been making graphics cards and chipsets in competition with Nvidia. Like Nvidia, AMD makes standalone graphics cards for desktop machines as well as integrated graphics chips for laptop use (and for desktops without a separate card). Like Nvidia, it's invested in a number of areas outside the graphics market too, and custom AMD chips can also be found in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles.

								<h3>Performance Comparison</h3>
								<p>Currently, the RTX 2080 Ti completely blows away every other consumer-grade graphics card with 11GB of GDDR6 memory and high-end Tensor and RT cores that will enable AI-controlled super sampling and real-time ray tracing. AMD right now doesn’t have anything in the same ballpark.
									AMD has always been known for being the clear value champions, whereas Nvidia usually has more powerful hardware.
									The lowest end current-generation graphics card in the RTX lineup is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060, with performance that outmatches the AMD Vega 56 at the same price point. And, while the prices for these two GPUs are mostly comparable, AMD is currently dominating the budget-to-mid-range product stack with the AMD Radeon RX 5700, which brings about 2GB more VRAM than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 at the same price point.
									At the end of the day, AMD and Nvidia are still occupying completely different sides of the marketplace right now especially since AMD might not have ray tracing until 2020, so the best choice is going to rely on what games you’re trying to play and at what resolution.
